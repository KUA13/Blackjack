# Blackjack

This is a program that allows the user to play blackjack in the terminal. The user will be prompted for the amount of money they would like to play with. Cards will be automatically dealt to the player. If neither the user or the dealer has a blackjack, the user will be prompted to enter '1' for hit or '2' for stand. After each hand, the user will asked if they would like to play again, '1' is yes and '2' is no. The program will continue running until the user selects "no" or they run out of money.
